# Hangman Game!
## Introduction
The aim of this project was to be able to create a functioning Hangman game. With the standard rules of hangman applied.  
  
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. Proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words or shortened words, are also not allowed. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the letter will appear in the correct position. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, an element of a stick figure will appear until it is fully displayed.
